				<p>When you haven’t been able to have the child you’ve always wanted, even after seeking help, it can be emotionally trying. We at Kofinas Fertility Group truly understand your hardship, and we’re here to provide you with the comprehensive, compassionate care you need to finally have the family of your dreams.</p>

				<p>Our fertility specialists are distinguished by their extensive experience, emotional receptivity, and specialized surgical skill. We’re committed to taking every necessary approach, and we offer many procedures that you won’t find at other fertility clinics, including surgery. Despite what you may have been told, surgery is often an important aspect of fertility care. And yet, many doctors are unwilling (or lack the capabilities) to operate, even when it will offer the best chances for a successful pregnancy. At Kofinas Fertility Group, we do it all, because that’s what it takes to give you a healthy, happy child at a rate you can afford.</p>

			<h2>Chosen for many reasons, but especially for our excellent outcomes.</h2>
			<p>Due to varied patient expectations, assorted definitions of success and differing program acceptance criteria between different fertility clinics, success rates remain a highly controversial subject. At Kofinas Fertility Group, we have a singular focus — giving you a healthy baby — and this focus forms the basis for how we evaluate our success.</p>

			<p>As pioneers of fertility care, we have earned our reputation as one of the best fertility centers in the nation. Our dedication to providing personal, customized care to every person we see and treat means that we’re willing to dedicate the time, energy and resources necessary to give you the family you’ve always wanted… and we’ve had great results.

			<h2>Leading-edge capabilities and advanced technology define Kofinas Fertility Group.</h2>
			<p>When it comes to the technology required to properly assess your fertility challenges and take the necessary steps to fix them, Kofinas Fertility Group has no limits. If a new piece of equipment is released and the science considers it beneficial to the process of giving our patients a family, then we will spare no resource in order to acquire it.</p>

			<p>Additionally, we incorporate the very latest techniques into our practice. With his vast experience and expertise, Dr. Kofinas can determine the effectiveness of new and experimental techniques and begin using them immediately, giving his patients the best chance at experiencing parenthood. In fact, Kofinas Fertility Group has a number of “firsts” in the Brooklyn area, meaning we have been successfully performing certain procedures longer than most other fertility doctors, and we uses that experience to give you a loving child.</p>

			<p>All of our physicians and technicians are highly trained, and excellent surgical skill is one of the primary traits we look for in our doctors, as half of fertility cases require surgery — a fact you won’t hear from many other fertility specialists.</p>

			<h2>Making fertility care affordable is one of our greatest responsibilities.</h2>
			<p>Insurance coverage for infertility is often more complicated than other medical treatments, and can vary quite a bit between different plans. For example, sometimes insurance covers infertility testing, but not treatment. At Kofinas Fertility Group, we do everything we can to keep finances from preventing you from having the child of your dreams, and we are happy to file your insurance claim for you.</p>

			<p>To give you more financial reassurance, we offer a 100% Insured Success IVF program that gives you three IVF cycles for a set price. And if you fail to achieve a viable 14-week pregnancy after three cycles under this plan, your money will be returned to you in full. Additionally, we offer a number of discount plans for IVF and affordable rates for our many other assessments and therapies.</p>
